# About app

First lab from Desicion Theory cource. It's a ruby app that implements solution to Pareto and Sleiter optimality problem.

## In `test.rb` specify the following features:
1. Provide filename of the file which contains matrix (rows - criteria, columns - alternatives). Example file `file.txt` is provided as a first param when instantiating `AlternativesOptimizator` class;
2. Provide optimality type (either `AlternativesOptimizator::PARETO` or `AlternativesOptimizator::SLEITER`) as a second param; 

## How to run this app
```shell
ruby test.rb
```
